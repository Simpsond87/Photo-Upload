## Description
This project is a basic back-end program built in PHP 7 using the Laravel framework. The Postman application acts as the front-end and takes input, sending it to the back-end which validates and purifies the data. If one of the required field, 'photo', is missing, there is an error message. Once inputting the photo file, the filename is saved in the database, which points to the storage folder in the project folder.

## Getting Started
To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run 'composer install' to install all of the necessary libraries, and 'php artisan serve' to run the server. You may then open this server connection in Postman. Open your terminal or GitBash and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Simpsond87/Photo-Upload.git
cd Photo-Upload
composer install
php artisan serve
```
